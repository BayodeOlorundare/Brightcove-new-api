# New Brightcove API
This is coding for the new Brightcove Api. This is a simple HTML video hub player page. The page includes the following:

+ 5 tabbed categories which can pull playlist from Brightcove Cloud.
+ previous/next button on the top of the page which populates the titles, and also loads the corresponding video in the video player when clicked. The buttons also appear and disappear depending on the place in the playlist.
+ Metadata area pulls the following:
  -Title
  -Custom category
  -Duration of video
  -Date created
  -Long description
  -Related link/text of video file
+ First category only pulls 10 videos from the cloud. This can be updated to pull as much videos as you'd want.
+ Load more button will reveal 3 more video entries onto the page. When no more videos present the "Load More" button disappears.
+ Tabs will load new playlists and the "Load More" button will also show if hidden previously.
+ When a video file is clicked the page will scroll up to the player before video plays.
+ Page is fully responsive for tablet and mobile platforms.
+ Page includes a pre-loader animation to allow the elements to load fully, or encase there are any errors with page.
